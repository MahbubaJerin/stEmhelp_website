                <h3>The Story Behind stEmhelp</h3>
                
                <p><strong>Nicholas Haritos</strong> is a distinguished Professional and Academic Engineer with over 50 years of experience in engineering education and practice. As the Managing Director of STRUCOMP P/L and former Charter Assessor for Engineers Australia, his passion for engineering education has shaped countless careers and educational programs.</p>

                <p><strong>Academic Excellence:</strong> Nicholas has held academic positions at The University of Melbourne since 1973 (currently an Honorary Principal Fellow) and at Swinburne University of Technology as an Adjunct Professor. Throughout his illustrious career, he has taught Statics, Mechanics of Solids/Materials, Structural Mechanics, Structural Analysis & Design, Finite Element Modelling, and Structural Dynamics & Earthquake Engineering to Civil, Structural, Mechanical, and Chemical Engineering students.</p>

                <p><strong>Why stEmhelp Was Created:</strong> Through decades of teaching, Nicholas observed a critical gap in STEM education - while Science, Technology, and Mathematics received adequate attention in schools, the "Engineering" component was often reduced to basic robotics and construction activities. He recognized that engineering activities naturally incorporate all STEM elements, making them the perfect vehicle for comprehensive STEM education.</p>

                <p><strong>The Vision:</strong> Nicholas founded stEmhelp to address the lack of engineering-focused activities in K-12 education. He identified two main challenges: teachers' limited understanding of engineering concepts and the shortage of available engineering-focused educational activities. stEmhelp was created to provide both the knowledge and resources needed to transform STEM education.</p>

                <p><strong>From Concept to Reality:</strong> His extensive teaching and practical consulting experience as Managing Director of STRUCOMP P/L (established 1996) drove the development of the user-friendly educational products. The success of the TechnoLab‚Ñ¢ teaching products, launched in 2014 for tertiary engineering education, inspired the creation of scaled-down, age-appropriate versions for K-12 students through stEmhelp.</p>

                <p><strong>Legacy and Impact:</strong> Today, Nicholas continues to champion engineering education through stEmhelp, ensuring that the next generation of students has access to engaging, hands-on engineering experiences that inspire curiosity and build foundational understanding of engineering principles.</p>
